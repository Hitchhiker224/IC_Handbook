# Non programmable ICs

Integrated Circuits(IC) are the cornerstone of modern electronics. They are basically an arrangement of various electronics components like op-amps,resistors, transistors etc. They are used extensively. 

## 555 Timer 

The 555 timer IC is an integrated circuit used in a variety of timer, pulse generation, and
oscillator applications. The 555 can be used to provide time delays, as an oscillator, and
as a flip-flop element.Its one of the most used ICs in the industry. It has 8 pins. The pin connections are shown below
